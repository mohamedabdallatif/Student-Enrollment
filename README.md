## features of App
- Enroll new student: Users can enroll new students by filling out a form that asks for personal information such as name, email, phone number, address, and course details. Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend server and stored in the SQL database.
- Search for a student: Users can search for a student by entering their name or ID in a search bar. The backend server queries the database and returns the relevant student information, which is displayed on the UI.
- Update student's data: Users can update a student's data by clicking on the relevant student in the search results and editing their information in a form. Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend server and updated in the SQL database.
- Delete student: Users can delete a student by clicking on the relevant student in the search results and confirming the deletion. Once the deletion is confirmed, the student's data is removed from the SQL database.
- Overall, the student enrollment project provides a user-friendly interface for managing student information and includes essential features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. By using Flutter for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and SQL for the database, the project is easy to maintain and scalable for futureÂ enhancements.
